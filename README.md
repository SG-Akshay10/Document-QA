# Document-QA

Document-QA is a comprehensive toolkit designed for implementing question answering on long texts or documents. It utilizes various embedding techniques such as Glove Embedding, Word2Vec, Bag Of Words, and the powerful BERT model to extract accurate answers from extensive textual data. Whether you're working with research papers, articles, or any other type of document, this project provides efficient methods to tackle complex queries and enhance document comprehension.

## Features
Multiple Embedding Techniques: Incorporates Glove Embedding, Word2Vec, Bag Of Words, and BERT for a diverse range of text representation options.
Question Answering on Long Texts: Specifically designed to handle lengthy texts or documents, enabling precise answers to questions even from extensive content.
Flexible Implementation: Offers flexibility in choosing the embedding technique based on the requirements and nature of the document.
Efficient Information Retrieval: Employs advanced models and techniques to streamline information retrieval processes, saving time and resources.
Easy to Use: Simple interface and straightforward implementation make it accessible to both beginners and experienced users.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow (for BERT)
* Gensim (for Word2Vec)
* NLTK (for Glove Embedding)

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BERT-Document-QA.git
```
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
* Prepare your document or text data in a suitable format.
* Choose the appropriate embedding technique (Glove Embedding, Word2Vec, Bag Of Words, or BERT) based on your requirements and the nature of the text.
* Use the provided functions or classes to preprocess the data and generate embeddings.
* Implement the question answering mechanism using the generated embeddings.
* Evaluate the performance of the model and fine-tune as necessary.
